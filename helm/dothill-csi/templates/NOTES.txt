Thank you for using Dothill-CSI. It will be soon up and running.

In order to dynamically provide a persistant volume, you have to create a storage class first. Please refer to this example to do so: https://github.com/enix/dothill-csi/blob/main/example/storage-class.yaml
Don't forget to install open-iscsi and multipath-tools on your hosts if it's not done yet, and make sure iscsid and multipathd are running.
